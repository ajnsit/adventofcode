# Purescript Advent Of Code

These are my Purescript [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.

After Year 2020 Day8, I switched to using the [Purescript AdventOfCode starter kit](https://github.com/fpindia/purescript-adventofcode). I also took this opportunity to move the primary branch to `main` instead of `master`.

The old code, including the code for Year2019 is still on the `master` branch.

## Installation

Clone the repo. Then run `npm install`.

## Usage

Run `./aoc run YEAR DAY` to run the solutions for a particular year and day.

See the documentation for [Purescript AdventOfCode starter kit](https://github.com/fpindia/purescript-adventofcode) for more information.
